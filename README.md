## Required Modules
**IMPORTANT** - Token Action HUD TheWitcherTRPG requires the [Token Action HUD Core](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-action-hud-core) module to be installed.

## Recommended Modules
Token Action HUD uses either the [Color Picker](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/color-picker), [libThemer](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/lib-themer) or [VTTColorSettings](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/colorsettings) library modules for its color picker settings. Only one is required.

I also recommend to use [Monk's Player Settings](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/monks-player-settings) to customize the HUD individually for your players depending on their character and/or the adventure.

## Recommended System Version
I recommend using my systems alpha version, since it includes some compatibility patches and other features. Even though it is not mandatory. [Here](https://github.com/ortegamarcel/TheWitcherTRPG/wiki) is a link to my alpha version and the [installation guide](https://github.com/ortegamarcel/TheWitcherTRPG/wiki/Installation-Guide).
